# Status <a name="id7"></a>

## Backend - Completed in an initial version 

This means there are things that I would like to change or implement but I considered it ready for deployment on the internet.

## Frontend - With pending tasks

this means some things are pending to have a completed version.

Pending things: Add some error cases in signIn and signUp, add unit testing to the components and modularize
some logic of the app related to signIn/Up flow, cookie flow, and interactivity with the global state.
